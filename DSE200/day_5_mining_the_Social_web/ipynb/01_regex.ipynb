Every list has an `.index()` method, and you can find the corresponding index number in the list for a given element passed to the method as an argument.  So if I wanted *where* in `patterns` was the regex `r'[^ABC]'`, I could use `patterns.index(re.compile(r'[^ABC]'))`.

If you just give it a int, by default it will treat that value is a stopping value and start from 0.   Now, we add 1 to this value because the end point is omitted in `range`.  If we want to return *all* the groups, we have to add that end point back.\n",
