    "Just as each chapter in this book has a corresponding Jupyter Notebook, each appendix also has a corresponding Jupyter Notebook. All notebooks, regardless of purpose, are maintained in the book's [GitHub source code repository](http://bit.ly/Mining-the-Social-Web-3E). The particular appendix that you are reading here \"in print\" serves as a special cross-reference to the Jupyter Notebook that provides step-by-step instructions for how to install and configure the book's virtual machine, facilitated using Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are strongly encouraged to use the book's associated Docker image as a development environment instead of using any existing Python installation you may have on your computer. There are some nontrivial configuration management issues involved in installing the Jupyter Notebook and all of its dependencies for scientific computing. The various other third-party Python packages that are used throughout the book and the need to support users across multiple platforms only exacerbate the complexity that can be involved in getting a basic development environment up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the somewhat unlikely event that you've somehow stumbled across this notebook outside of its context on GitHub, [you can find the full source code repository here](http://bit.ly/Mining-the-Social-Web-3E)."

    "## Quick Start Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the [Docker Engine (Community Edition)](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) appropriate to your own operating system or platform\n",
    "2. Install a [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system\n",
    "    * Alternatively, install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) app\n",
    "3. Clone the git [repository](https://github.com/mikhailklassen/Mining-the-Social-Web-3rd-Edition) for _Mining the Social Web_\n",
    "    * From the command line:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone git@github.com:mikhailklassen/Mining-the-Social-Web-3rd-Edition.git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Navigate to the directory on your computer where the cloned repository resides. There should be a file called `docker-compose.yml` in this folder.\n",
    "5. Type `docker-compose up`\n",
    "    * Docker-compose is a tool for controlling multi-container applications. We use two Docker containers: one for running the Jupyter Notebook and almost all their dependencies, and one for running MongoDB, a database that we use in the Twitter Recipes chapter. Running `docker-compose up` will build or download the necessary Docker images to run our applications. This may take a while if it is the first time running this command, but it should run quicker in the future.\n",
    "6. After this finishes, there should be some instructions that appear in the terminal:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    mtsw_1     | [C 20:11:25.760 NotebookApp] \n",
    "    mtsw_1     |     \n",
    "    mtsw_1     |     Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,\n",
    "    mtsw_1     |     to login with a token:\n",
    "    mtsw_1     |         http://(9302d900fdc4 or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=2c14bdc6...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I've truncated the token here. Copy the URL and paste it into your browser, e.g.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=2c14bdc6...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will navigate to the running application on your local computer. The token exists for secure authentication.\n",
    "7. You should now see a web application running Jupyter."

    "## What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.\" -- From the [Docker Overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to go with Docker because it allowed us to build a consistent Jupyter Notebook experience for _Mining the Social Web_, no matter what operating system our readers were using. With Docker installed, it only takes a few commands to get up and running without having to worry about installing any of the dependencies."

    "\n",
    "In the event that you've never used a version control system such as Git to obtain or manage source code, be assured that it's well worth the investment to learn Git fundamentals. The first two chapters of the free [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub are particularly worth the 15 or so minutes that it takes to complete, and you'll also find that Stack Overflow also contains a plethora of answers to common Git questions and best practice guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute minimum Git skills that you'll want to know for consuming the source code of this book include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `git clone` - With git, you _clone_ a repository to get its source code, and you'll need to `https://github.com/mikhailklassen/Mining-the-Social-Web-3rd-Edition` to get source code for this repository. (The repository URL is provided in the right margin of https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition if you missed it.) \n",
    "* `git status` - You can check the _status_ of your repository by typing `git status` in the source code directory that you cloned. A common reason that you'll use `git status` is to determine if there are updates in the _remote_ repository that you can _pull_ down.\n",
    "* `git pull` - Whenever the maintainer of a repository makes an update, you can _pull_ the update by simply typing `git pull` in the source code directory that you cloned.\n",
    "* `git checkout` - You can use `git checkout` to _checkout_ a file you may have modified to restore it to its previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you become more comfortable with Git, you may want to _fork_ a Git repository, _commit_ changes to it, and _push_ your changes to the master branch on GitHub. Consult https://git-scm.com/ for more information on how to do these things when you are ready to make that additional leap.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are certainly able to download a zip archive of a GitHub repository's [source code](https://github.com/mikhailklassen/Mining-the-Social-Web-3rd-Edition) (look for the \"Download ZIP\" button in the right margin), but doing so would be a bit ironic. This book is all about the social web, and you'd be avoiding the premier social coding platform that hosts its project code. GitHub is inherently social, and there are benefits to participating that you can't gain any other way besides plugging in, being part of the community, and applying some Git fundamentals to contribute from time to time. Forking code, opening pull requests, and otherwise contributing within the boundaries of the GitHub platform tooling is much easier than you might initially think because GitHub delivers such a tremendous user experience. Take a few extra minutes to checkout the source code from GitHub instead of downloading a zip archive. You'll be glad that you took those steps."
