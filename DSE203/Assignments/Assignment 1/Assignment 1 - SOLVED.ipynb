    "In the cells above there are two pieces of data displayed, one being an example output for the target ingredients (from the random 20 list) with the matched list of ingredients coming from all the data (only a few are displayed) while the other one is a table of count for Recipe IDs matched, both display data across the different similarity measures tested including Cosine, Dice, Jaccard, Overlap Coefficients, and Tversky Index with threshold values of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "By visual inspection is very clear that the similarity measures are working by comparing the list of ingrents matched with the target ingredient, however, is hard to review and validate manually thousands of string matches. For this reason, I took the approach of basically counting the number of Recipe IDs matched and compare across the threshold parameters and similarity measures. The tables above showed that as we increase the threshold value the number of matches decreases, this is obviously expected, but what is interesting is that some ingredients keep relatively similar number of matches such as \"sauerkraut\", \"onion\", and \"carrots\". On another observation, the order of the number of matches across similarity measures is consistently preserved where Overlap Coefficient is the highest and Jaccard is the lowest, this is true for all threshold values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is hard to determine in a detail manner which measure is the most effective without labeling the data, and therefore calculting accuracy with metrics such as Precision and Recall. But for simplicity and ease of analysis we can make two arguments, one being that the similarity measurement with the greatest number of matches is likely performing the best, which in this case is Overlap Coefficient. In fact, all measures have very similar number of matches with the exception of Jaccard; this applies to all threshold values tested. On the other hand, we can argue that Jaccard has better accuracy for true positives than the other measurements and for this reason is expressing less matches. \n"

    "\n",
    "The results from this part are quite interesting, they follow the similar order of match numbers (\"Overlap Coefficient\" being the highest while \"Jaccard\" the lowest) found on previous parts, but now it revealed more information about how each method performs with specific example words. First, the query for \"spinutch\" was not found anywhere and is likely because all of the methods tested above are set-based and we need something more granular like sequence-based measures to handle typos or any other variations when spelling. Second, the query \"onions and garlic\" had 3899 matches with the method \"Overlap Coefficient\" and 1 match \"Cosine\", and the rest had zero matches. Next, the queries for \"hot water\", \"seasoning (Italian)\", and \"roasted beef\" returned the same number of matches across all methods with 4161, 89, and 604 respectively with the exception of \"Jaccard\". As observed in parts (a) and (b) above \"Jaccard\" is the method with the lowest number of matches, and likewise in this part it only found matches for the query \"hot water\" with 199 while the others had zero matches. As mentioned before, without performance metrics and labels is hard to determine precisely which method is better but to generalize if we had to select a method I would go with \"Overlap Coefficient\" since it has the highest number of matches, I think is nice to have the extra information is collecting and perhaps filter or clean it with other techniques downstream.
