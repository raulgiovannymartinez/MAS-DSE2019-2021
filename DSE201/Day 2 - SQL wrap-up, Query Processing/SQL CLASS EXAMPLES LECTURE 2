-- Question:
Problem:
•  Find the students that take every class ‘John
Smith’ takes
Rephrase:
•  Find the students such that there is no class that
‘John Smith’ takes and they do not take


-- You can create a view for the classes that John Smith has taken
CREATE VIEW JohnsClasses AS

	SELECT ej.class
	FROM students j, enrollments ej
	WHERE ej.student = j.id AND
			j.first_name = 'John' AND
			j.last_name = 'Smith'


-- Now select all the students that are enrolled in the same class as John

CREATE VIEW MissedOneClass AS 

	SELECT s.id
	FROM students s, JohnClasses c
	WHERE NOT EXISTS (
		SELECT 
		FROM enrollments e
		WHERE  e.class = c AND e.student = s.id
	)

-- Finally select the negation (or complement) of students that missed a class that john takes 
	
	SELECT *
	FROM students s
	WHERE s.id NOT IN (
		SELECT * FROM MissedOneClass
	)

CREATE VIEW MAS201Students AS

	SELECT s.id
	FROM students s, enrollment e, classes c
	WHERE e.student = s.id AND e.class = c.id
	AND c.number = 'MAS201'


	SELECT c.start_time, c.end_time, c.date_code, COUNT(DISTINCT e.student)
	FROM enrollments e, classes cs
	WHERE c.number < > 'MAS201'
		AND e.class = c.id
		AND e.id IN (
			SELECT * FROM MAS201Students
		)
	GROUP BY c.start_time, c.end_time, c.date_code
