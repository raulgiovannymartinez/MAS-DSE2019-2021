# # Homework 2
# 
# In this homework, we are going to play with Twitter data.
# 
# The data is represented as rows of of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example) strings.
# It consists of [tweets](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets), [messages](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types), and a small amount of broken data (cannot be parsed as JSON).
# 
# For this homework, we will only focus on tweets and ignore all other messages.
# 
# 
# ## Tweets
# 
# A tweet consists of many data fields. [Here is an example](https://gist.github.com/arapat/03d02c9b327e6ff3f6c3c5c602eeaf8b). You can learn all about them in the Twitter API doc. We are going to briefly introduce only the data fields that will be used in this homework.
# 
# * `created_at`: Posted time of this tweet (time zone is included)
# * `id_str`: Tweet ID - we recommend using `id_str` over using `id` as Tweet IDs, becauase `id` is an integer and may bring some overflow problems.
# * `text`: Tweet content
# * `user`: A JSON object for information about the author of the tweet
#     * `id_str`: User ID
#     * `name`: User name (may contain spaces)
#     * `screen_name`: User screen name (no spaces)
# * `retweeted_status`: A JSON object for information about the retweeted tweet (i.e. this tweet is not original but retweeteed some other tweet)
#     * All data fields of a tweet except `retweeted_status`
# * `entities`: A JSON object for all entities in this tweet
#     * `hashtags`: An array for all the hashtags that are mentioned in this tweet
#     * `urls`: An array for all the URLs that are mentioned in this tweet
# 
# 
# ## Data source
# 
# All tweets are collected using the [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview).
# 
# 
# ## Users partition
# 
# Besides the original tweets, we will provide you with a Pickle file, which contains a partition over 452,743 Twitter users. It contains a Python dictionary `{user_id: partition_id}`. The users are partitioned into 7 groups.

# In[1]:

# To test on your laptop, set `ON_EMR=False`

# # Part 0: Load data to a RDD

# The tweets data is stored on AWS S3. We have in total a little over 1 TB of tweets. We provide 10 MB of tweets for your local development. For the testing and grading on the homework server, we will use different data.
# 
# ## Testing on the homework server
# On EdX, we provide three different input sizes to test your program: 10 MB, 1 GB, and 10 GB. For any run, we will only be using one of these four datasets.
# 
# For submission and for local testing, make sure to read the path of the file you want to operate with from `./hw2-files.txt`. Otherwise your program will receive no points.
# 
# ## Local test
# 
# For local testing, please create your own `hw2-files.txt` file, which contains a single file path on the local disk, e.g.
# `file://<absolute_path_to_current_directory>/hw2-files-10mb.txt`. For final submission, we will create this file on our server for testing with the appropriate file path. If your implementation is correct, you should not worry about which file system (i.e. local file system or HDFS) Spark will read data from.
# 
# Now let's see how many lines there are in the input files.
# 
# 1. Make RDD from the data in the file given by the file path present in `hw2-files.txt`. (hint: use [the `textFile()` method](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext.textFile))
# 2. Mark the RDD to be cached (so in next operation data will be loaded in memory) 
# 3. call the `count` method to print number of lines in all these files
# 
# <b>It should print<b>
# ```
# Number of elements: 2150
# ```

# 
# The data of this assignment may contain broken tweets (invalid JSON strings). So make sure that your code is robust for such cases.
# 
# You can filter out such broken tweet by checking if:
# * the line is not in json format
# 
# In addition, some lines in the input file might not be tweets, but messages that the Twitter server sent to the developer (such as [limit notices](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types#limit_notices)). Your program should also ignore these messages.
# 
# These messages would not contain the `created_at` field and can be filtered out accordingly.
# * Check if json object of the broken tweet has a `created_at` field

Note that even if some users might mention a token $t$ multiple times or in multiple tweets, a user will contribute at most 1 to the counter of the token $t$.
# 
# Please make sure that the number of mentions of a token is equal to the number of users who mentioned this token but NOT the number of tweets that mentioned this token.
# 
# Let $N_t^k$ be the number of mentions of the token $t$ in the user partition $k$. Let $N_t^{all} = \sum_{i=0}^7 N_t^{i}$ be the number of total mentions of the token $t$.
# 
# We define the relative popularity of a token $t$ in a user partition $k$ as the log ratio between $N_t^k$ and $N_t^{all}$, i.e. 
# 
# \begin{equation}
# p_t^k = \log \frac{N_t^k}{N_t^{all}}.
# \end{equation}
# 
# 
# You can compute the relative popularity by calling the function `get_rel_popularity`.

"""
This code implements a basic, Twitter-aware tokenizer.

A tokenizer is a function that splits a string of text into words. In
Python terms, we map string and unicode objects into lists of unicode
objects.

There is not a single right way to do tokenizing. The best method
depends on the application.  This tokenizer is designed to be flexible
and this easy to adapt to new domains and tasks.  The basic logic is
this:

1. The tuple regex_strings defines a list of regular expression
   strings.

2. The regex_strings strings are put, in order, into a compiled
   regular expression object called word_re.

3. The tokenization is done by word_re.findall(s), where s is the
   user-supplied string, inside the tokenize() method of the class
   Tokenizer.

4. When instantiating Tokenizer objects, there is a single option:
   preserve_case.  By default, it is set to True. If it is set to
   False, then the tokenizer will downcase everything except for
   emoticons.

The __main__ method illustrates by tokenizing a few examples.

I've also included a Tokenizer method tokenize_random_tweet(). If the
twitter library is installed (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
and Twitter is cooperating, then it should tokenize a random
English-language tweet.
