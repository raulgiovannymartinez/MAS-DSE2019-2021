In the Data Science and Engineering program, engineering professionals combine the skills of software programmer, database manager, and statistician to create mathematical models of the data, identify trends/deviations, then present them in effective visual ways that can be understood by others.

Data scientists unlock new sources of economic value, provide fresh insights into science, and inform decision makers by analyzing large, diverse, complex, longitudinal, and distributed data sets generated from instruments, sensors, internet transactions, email, video, and other digital sources.

Students entering the MAS program for a degree in Data Science and Engineering will undertake courses in programming, analysis, and applications management and visualization. This program requires three foundational courses, four core courses, and two electives totaling thirty-four units, plus a capstone team project course of four units, for a total of thirty-eight units.
